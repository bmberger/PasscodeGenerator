# PasscodeGenerator
AUTHOR: Briana Berger

PURPOSE OF PROJECT: The purpose of the code is to while loops and if statements alongside ASCII to print out randomly generated passwords based on the user's option choice and password length. The code also makes use of reading and writing to files.

VERSION or DATE: 01/09/2018

DIFFICULTIES: When I first attempted this program during winter break, I got stuck. I tried for hours. It kept printing out the same password, even though I knew my code was correct. So, I decided to skip it for now and come back later. Coming back, I had the same problem. However, I went through my code and saw that it was because I didn’t reset my user’s password length (I already knew I had to reset the password, but it kept messing up, so I knew something else was wrong). Without reseting the user’s password length, the compiler would skip right over my while loop and it would keep the same password. I did fix it though by adding in a reset for the password and the user’s password length. 

LEARNING MOMENTS: The lesson really taught me debugging. On most of my projects, debugging goes relatively quick. However, this forced me to really analyze my code and look at each variable.
